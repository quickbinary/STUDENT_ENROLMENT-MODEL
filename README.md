# STUDENT ENROLMENT MODEL
A model that can predict students who are likely to enroll in a particular program and which ones may need additional support to graduate.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can identify students likely to enroll in a specific program and those who might require additional support to graduate successfully. By leveraging **historical student enrollment data, academic records, and demographic information,** the aim is to create **a model that assists in predicting enrollment patterns** and providing early intervention strategies for supporting student graduation.

## Problem Statement

The model aims to address two primary challenges:

**Enrollment Prediction**: Predict which students are likely to enroll in a particular educational program based on past records and demographics.

**Graduation Support Identification:** Identify students who might need additional support to enhance their chances of graduating successfully.

## How to Use
Requirements

 +Python (with necessary libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, etc.)

 +Jupyter Notebook or any Python development environment
### Steps
+Clone or download the repository.

+Open the Jupyter Notebook or Python script for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

+Follow the provided instructions to load data, preprocess it, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

+Use the trained model to predict student enrollment and identify students requiring additional support.
