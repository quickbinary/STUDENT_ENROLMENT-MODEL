# STUDENT_ENROLMENT-MODEL
A model that can predict students who are likely to enroll in a particular program and which ones may need additional support to graduate.

**Objective**

The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can identify students likely to enroll in a specific program and those who might require additional support to graduate successfully. By leveraging **historical student enrollment data, academic records, and demographic information,** the aim is to create **a model that assists in predicting enrollment patterns** and providing early intervention strategies for supporting student graduation.

**Problem Statement**

The model aims to address two primary challenges:

**Enrollment Prediction**: Predict which students are likely to enroll in a particular educational program based on past records and demographics.

**Graduation Support Identification:** Identify students who might need additional support to enhance their chances of graduating successfully.
